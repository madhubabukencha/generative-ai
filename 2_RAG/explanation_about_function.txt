########## RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter##########

-> separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]:
This argument specifies the characters or sequences of characters 
that will be used to identify potential chunk boundaries. In this case,
 the splitter will prioritize splitting at double newlines, single 
 newlines, periods followed by a space, spaces, and finally, at character 
 boundaries if no other separators are found.
