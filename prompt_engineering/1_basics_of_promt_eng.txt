Two types of Large Language Models(LLMs):
* Base LLMs: Predicts next word, based on text training data
  * Examples are 
    Today morning I went movie
	                     -----
    Today morning I went for hiking
	                     ----------
  * It might the give wrong answers if you ask something like "What is population of India?", It might response with below prompts.
    what is the India largest city?
	what is the India's capital?

* Instruction Tuned LLM's:
  Instruction Tuned LLM's are primarily built on Base LLMs and then fine tuned with instructions(inputs and outputs) to achieve specific task.
  often used Reinforcement Learning With Human Feedback(RLHF) for fine tuning.
